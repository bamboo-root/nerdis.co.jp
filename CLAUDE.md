## Repository Overview

This is a static website for Nerdis LLC hosted on GitHub Pages at www.nerdis.co.jp. The site consists of simple HTML pages with inline CSS styling.

## Architecture

- **Static HTML Site**: No build process or framework required
- **Inline CSS**: All styling is embedded within each HTML file
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Site is deployed automatically via GitHub Pages with custom domain (CNAME file)

## Page Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page with all sections inline
- `services.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html` - Subpages currently showing "under construction" placeholders

## Development Workflow

No build or compilation steps needed. Changes to HTML files are directly reflected when pushed to the repository.

## Deployment

Site deploys automatically to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
